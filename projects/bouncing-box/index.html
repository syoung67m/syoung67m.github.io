			Comment from ben:
			
			This is a good start Sarah! Let's go over a few things to get this working just right.
			
			1) What does position = position + (speed * direction) actually do?
			The position variable determines where we move the box to. Let's suppose that 
			position = 500. When we use the function "box.css('left', position)" we are
			setting the box's x-coordinate to 500. If we increase the value of position, then 
			the box moves the right. Decreasing it moves it to the left. This is why we var direction. 
			By setting direction to 1 or -1 we can control whether or not position gets 
			bigger (moves to the right) or smaller (moves to the left):
			
				direction = 1							direction = - 1
				position = position + speed		vs. 	position = position - speed
				
			2) Now we have to decide WHEN - that's where the if statement comes in. If the position
			ever gets to the point that it has hit the right wall then we want to move it back to the
			left (i.e. set direction to -1). We can tell that this happens by checking to see if 
			position is greater than boardWidth (which you've done!). However, we don't want to reset
			the position back to 0 or else we will just be moving the box ALL the way to the left.
			
			3) Now all that is left is to determine when to move the box to the right. Knowing
			that the x-coordinate of the LEFT wall is x = 0, how can you create an if statement
			that makes the box bounce to the right when it hits this wall?

			update = function() {
				// TODO 3 / 6 / 7 / 8
				position = position + (speed * direction);
				if(position > boardWidth){
					direction = -1;
					// position = 0; we don't want to do this!
				}
				box.css('left', position);
				box.text(points);
				position = position + speed; // this is also extra at this point since we are already deciding how to change position above
			};


			/** Comment from Ben: Great work here! */
			handleBoxClick = function() {
				// TODO 4 / 5
				speed = speed + 3;
				position = 0;
				points = points + 1
				
			};


			//this calls update every 50 milliseconds
			setInterval(update, 50);
			// this calls the handle handleBoxClick function every time the box is clicked on
			box.on('click', handleBoxClick);
